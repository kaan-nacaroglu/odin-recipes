<p>Menemen is a traditional Turkish dish that includes eggs, peppers, tomatoes and spices that are all cooked down in a pan with oil. Like Shakshuka, you can serve it for breakfast, but it can be and is often served as the main course.
</p>
<p>
    Every Turkish student knows how to make menemen. It's a very easy dish to make, it's filling and it's cheap. 
</p>
<p>It is usually served with some crusty bread for sopping up all the pan sauce, and I highly recommend doing so. You don't want any of that awesomeness going to waste.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>Serves to 2 people</p>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil
    </li>
    <li>1 small onion diced (white or yellow, optional)
    </li>
    <li>1 cup chopped peppers </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon spicy chili flakes</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic minced
    </li>
    <li>1.5 cups grated or diced tomatoes with their juices
    </li>
    <li>5 eggs
    </li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large pan to medium heat and add the olive oil.
    </li>
    <li>Add the onion, peppers and chili flakes and cook them down about 5 minutes, until softened.
    </li>
    <li>Add the garlic and cook another minute.
    </li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes with a bit of salt and pepper and stir them up. Cook them down until the tomatoes soften and lose some of their juices. Don't let the pan dry out. About 10 minutes or so.
    </li>
    <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl very lightly, then pour them into the pan. Tilt the pan a bit to let the egg mixture drip into the many nooks and crannies of your sauce. Do not mix it through.
    </li>
    <li>Cook them a couple minutes, or until the eggs are starting to set. Remove from heat and let the eggs finish cooking in the warm sauce, a few minutes more. If you prefer your eggs more set, just cook them longer as desired.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle with fresh herbs, crumbly feta cheese and spicy chili flakes. Serve with warmed bread or tortillas.
    </li>
</ol>
